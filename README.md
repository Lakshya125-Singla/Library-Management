# Library-Management
The Library Management System is a full-stack web application designed to efficiently manage library operations such as maintaining books, issuing/returning books, and handling user roles (admin and staff). The system is built using Java Servlet & JSP for the backend, MySQL as the database, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend interface.
✨ Key Features:

👩‍💼 Role-Based Access – Separate dashboards for Admin and Staff.

📊 Dashboard – Displays statistics like total books, issued books, available books, and staff activity.

🌐 Responsive UI – Designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for smooth user experience across devices.

🛠️ Tech Stack:

Backend: Java Servlets, JSP (Java Server Pages)

Database: MySQL (books, users, and issued_books tables)

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

Server: Apache Tomcat

🎯 Outcome:
This project delivers a real-world library automation system, demonstrating practical knowledge of Java web development, MVC architecture, database integration, and responsive design. It is highly useful for managing medium to large-scale library operations digitally.
